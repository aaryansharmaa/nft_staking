NFT Staking 
====================

Project Description
-------------------
This project implements an NFT staking mechanism using ERC20 and ERC721 tokens. Users can stake their NFTs to earn ERC20 token rewards.

Setup Instructions
------------------
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/nft-staking.git
   cd nft-staking

2. Install dependencies:
   npm install

Deployment Instructions
-----------------------
1. Compile the contracts:
   npx hardhat compile

2. Deploy the contracts:
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network [network]

Testing Instructions
--------------------
1. Update the token ID in the testing script to a number greater than 5 to avoid gas errors, as previous IDs may have already been used during testing:
   Example: const mintNftTx = await ERC721Mock.mint(deployer.address, 6); // Use a token ID greater than 5

2. Run the tests:
   npx hardhat test

Contract Addresses
------------------
Replace these placeholders with your actual deployed contract addresses:
- ERC20Mock: YOUR_DEPLOYED_ERC20MOCK_ADDRESS
- ERC721Mock: YOUR_DEPLOYED_ERC721MOCK_ADDRESS
- NFTStaking: YOUR_DEPLOYED_NFTSTAKING_ADDRESS


Passing Tests Cases
---------------------
